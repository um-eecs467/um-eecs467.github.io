We will use mainly [Slack](um-engin-467arf23.slack.com) to discuss project/lab/homework related issues. Enrolled students should receive an invite. If you are not able to join slack, please reach out to Jorge (GSI).

The GitLab site template code repositories for EECS 467 are available [HERE](https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/eecs467-fa23/). We may also provide links to additional github/gitlab/google drive as supplemental instructions/resources.
